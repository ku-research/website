<p><strong>Kristin V. Monroe</strong>, author of <a href="http://collections.knowledgeunlatched.org/collection-availability-2/"><em>The Insecure City: Space, Power, and Mobility in Beirut</em></a> (Rutgers University Press)<br>
</p>
<p><em><strong>What were your hopes for your book, and do you think Open Access has played a role in achieving them?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my field (cultural anthropology), it is common to hear scholars describe their books as being ones that undergraduate students can read, understand, and learn from. But as I began my teaching career, I found very few ethnographic texts that were accessible to the students I teach in my mid-level and even upper level undergraduate classes. My aim was to write a book that could reach a broad audience of students not only in the U.S. but around the globe.</p>
<p> I think that Open Access will have a very significant role to play in making this aim achievable. I’m also very pleased that my book will be part of the endeavor to democratize knowledge - Open Access is an important part of this. I’m also excited about the possibilities for Open Access to internationalize my book – by bringing it to scholars and students outside of the U.S.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think that making your book available on an OA licence has increased its reach and impact?  Have you seen any concrete indications of this?</strong></em></p>
<p>My book was only recently published, a few months ago, but already I received notice that it was selected as a “Book of the Day” by Unglue.it, a program of the Free Ebook Foundation that supports sustainable funding and distribution for Creative Commons and other freely licensed books. This was very gratifying!<br>
  </p>
<p><em><strong>How have you been promoting your OA book?</strong></em><br>
  </p>
<p>Mainly through colleagues at other institutions who might adopt the book for their courses. Also through contacts in the Middle East where I just returned from doing research this summer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Has your opinion about OA in general changed since your book was published through the Knowledge Unlatched collection? If so, how?</strong></em></p>
<p>So far, my opinion has not changed, I am very committed to Open Access projects.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do your friends/colleagues think about your decision to allow your book to be made available for free under a CC licence? Has their opinion changed following publication through Knowledge Unlatched?</strong></em></p>
<p>So far, I’ve only heard very positive and supportive comments and remarks about my decision to make my book available for free under a CC license.</p>
<p><em><strong>Any other comments?</strong></em></p>
<p>Happy to be part of Knowledge Unlatched!</p>
