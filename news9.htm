<p><strong>Frances Pinter is stepping down from her position as executive director of Knowledge Unlatched Research</strong>, the independent policy analysis and research group, in the spring. Her successor will be Cameron Neylon, former advocacy director of PLOS and currently Professor of Research Communication at the Centre for Culture and Technology. Neylon divides his time between his home in Bath and his office at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.<br>
  </p>
<p>Pinter has spent well over four decades in academic publishing with a history of challenging the status quo. Most recently she was a leading advocate for sustainable Open Access publishing for books. She will continue with a few board positions while pursuing other interests outside of scholarly publishing.<br>
    <br>
  Frances Pinter said – it’s been an honour and privilege to have held so many positions in publishing, worked with so many talented people and to have facilitated others to achieve their goals. I am delighted that Knowledge Unlatched Research, my last start-up in the industry, will be in Cameron’s very capable hands.<br>
    <br>
  Cameron Neylon said – Frances leaves extremely large shoes to fill at Knowledge Unlatched Research. Her contribution and development of KUR leaves it well placed to deliver insight and support to publishers, librarians, authors and users of scholarly books at a critical time in their development. I am very excited for the opportunity to build and expand on KUR’s platform, working with very talented individuals who are committed to developing improved tools that enable a better understanding of the new open digital ecology.<br>
    <br>
  Lucy Montgomery, Head of Research at Knowledge Unlatched Research said – Frances’s lifetime commitment to forging new paths in scholarly communication has created a powerful legacy and illuminated new possibilities for researchers and publishers alike. We thank her for her generosity, vision and the foundations she laid. Cameron brings a unique combination of skills to the position of Executive Director of Knowledge Unlatched Research: as both a researcher working at the cutting edge of Open Access, and as a respected commentator on Open Access policy and practice. <br>
