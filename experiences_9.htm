<p><strong>KU Pilot author Jennifer Fredette,</strong> author of <em><a href="http://collections.knowledgeunlatched.org/collection-availability-1/">Constructing Muslims in France </a></em>(Temple University Press).</p>
<p><em><strong>What were your hopes for your book, and do you think Open Access has played a role in achieving them?</strong></em></p>
<p>I hoped my book would help academics and (though it feels a cliché to say it) the general public develop a more nuanced understanding of the lived experience of Muslims in France. </p>
<p>For me, Open Access has been indispensible. I have been able to easily share my work with colleagues and other academics via links in email and twitter, and I’ve seen others retweet the link to my book – especially in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo/Hypercacher attacks in early January. You can imagine how valuable that instantaneous ability to share my book with others proved when events unfolded – much faster than a trip to the library or even a LexisNexis search.</p>
<p>Had it been published solely as a traditional book, few outside of academia would have read it, in all likelihood. It is challenging for academics to reach a general audience. I took care to write my book in an accessible manner, but it is still very much a university press publication.</p>
<p>With KU, however, I was able to add a link directly to my book in the articles I wrote for the <em>Washington Post</em>’s “Monkey Cage Blog” this past summer and fall. The <em>Washington Post</em> articles reached a wider audience than anything I have ever written before (the second article alone received 10,000 hits in just a few days), and I had the satisfaction of knowing that if readers wanted to read my book, it was just a click away. </p>
<p>I have to believe that the easy availability of the book was behind Al Jazeera America finding me online and requesting my participation as a panellist on their program “Inside Story,” as well. In short, Knowledge Unlatched’s pilot project in Open Access played a vital role in helping me achieve my goals for my book. I could not be more thrilled for my book to be a part of this program. I do not believe I can publish my next book without insisting on an Open Access option: it’s the ethical thing for researchers to do, and it simply makes good business sense for authors in terms of distributing our work.</p>
<p><em><strong>How have you been promoting your OA book?</strong></em></p>
<p>Twitter, in op-eds in the Washington Post’s “Monkey Cage” blog, targeted email distribution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Has your opinion about OA in general changed since your book was published through the Knowledge Unlatched Pilot? If so, how?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is even more useful than I had imagined. And I did not realize the digital version would be such high quality. It is beautiful. And searchable!</p>
<p><em><strong>What do your friends/colleagues now think about your decision to allow your book to be made available for free under a CC licence? Has their opinion changed following publication through Knowledge Unlatched?</strong></em></p>
<p>There have been quite a few “Oh, really? That’s cool!” moments. I have one colleague in particular who is in France at the moment and it was so easy to send him a link to the book. He even said this is actually how he prefers to read books now. I recall a sympathetic editor at another press telling me several years ago that I should never mention an interest in Open Access to an editor. Thanks to KU, I think editors should actually be considering how much their presses have to gain with OA.</p>
<p><strong>Any other comments?</strong></p>
<p>Huge thanks to you all and to Alex Holzman for leading Temple into this new and exciting territory and offering me a chance to come along for the ride.<br>
