<p><strong>Adrian H. Hearn</strong>, author of <a href="Adrian H. Hearn, author of Diaspora and Trust: Cuba, Mexico, and the Rise of China (Duke University Press)"><em>Diaspora and Trust: Cuba, Mexico, and the Rise of China </em></a>(Duke University Press)<br>
</p>
<p><em><strong>What were your hopes for your book, and do you think Open Access has played a role in achieving them?</strong></em></p>
<p>My main goal was for the book to have a wide readership; yes, I think OA has supported this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think that making your book available on an OA licence has increased its reach and impact? Have you seen any concrete indications of this?</strong></em></p>
<p>I do not know if OA has increased the book’s “impact” in the traditional sense of journal citations; but I expect it will. I know that colleagues around the world (particularly in Cuba, Mexico, and China) are reading the book and may not have been able to otherwise.</p>
<p><em><strong>What other benefits have you seen from participating in Knowledge Unlatched?</strong></em></p>
<p>Students have requested the book’s OA link, and are unlikely to have read the book if it had to be purchased.<br>
  </p>
<p><em><strong>How have you been promoting your OA book?</strong></em><br>
  </p>
<p>I have included the link to the book’s OA page in PowerPoint presentations for seminars and conference papers around the world, and in university classes in Australia and China. I have also emailed the link to colleagues, and added the link to my email signature. I have shared the link in an online (Facebook) forum that I am a member of.</p>
<p><em><strong>Has your opinion about OA in general changed since your book was published through the Knowledge Unlatched collection? If so, how?</strong></em></p>
<p>I always supported the concept of OA, and seeing my book as part of the program strengthens my support. It is very useful to simply email a URL to friends and colleagues so that they can freely download the book without having to register or join a group.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do your friends/colleagues think about your decision to allow your book to be made available for free under a CC licence? Has their opinion changed following publication through Knowledge Unlatched?</strong></em></p>
<p>Several colleagues are puzzled by KU’s business model – and I confess I am not completely sure how it works – but nobody has suggested that OA is a bad or unwise decision. On the contrary, several colleagues have contacted me to ask how they might also include their books in a future KU list.</p>
